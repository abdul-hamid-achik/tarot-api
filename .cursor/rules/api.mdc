# Tarot API Documentation

## API Structure

The Tarot API follows RESTful principles and is organized as follows:

- All endpoints are under the `/api/v1/` prefix
- Resources are named using plural nouns (e.g., `/cards`, `/readings`)
- Standard HTTP methods are used (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- Response format follows JSON:API specification

## Authentication

Three authentication methods are supported:

1. **JWT Bearer Token** (Primary Method)
   - Standard for user authentication
   - Format: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
   - Obtain via `/api/v1/auth/login` or `/api/v1/auth/register`
   - Refresh via `/api/v1/auth/refresh` using the refresh token
   - Short-lived with refresh token capability
   - Used for regular user sessions

2. **HTTP Basic Authentication** (Alternative)
   - For direct access and simple integrations
   - Format: `Authorization: Basic <base64(email:password)>`
   - Primarily for testing and development
   - Lower rate limits than JWT authentication

3. **API Key Authentication** (For Automated Systems)
   - For automated systems and services
   - Format: `X-API-Key: <api-key>`
   - Create via `/api/v1/api_keys` endpoints (requires user authentication)
   - Each key is tied to a specific user account
   - Keys can have expiration dates and usage limits
   - Supports configurable rate limits per key

Multiple authentication methods can be enabled simultaneously, with precedence in the order: JWT, API Key, Basic Auth.

## API Keys Management

- API keys are managed through dedicated endpoints
- Only registered users can create and manage API keys
- Each key has:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Optional expiration date
  - Usage limits
  - Scoped permissions
- Keys are shown only once during creation
- Inactive or expired keys are automatically rejected
- Usage is tracked for analysis and rate limiting

## Documentation

- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation available at `/api/docs`
- ReDoc UI provides a user-friendly interface
- All authentication methods are documented
- Response schemas and example payloads are included
- Interactive testing available in documentation UI

## Rate Limiting

- All API endpoints have rate limits
- Rates vary by authentication method and user tier
- Headers include rate limit information:
  - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests per period
  - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests
  - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time until limit resets

## Versioning

- API versioning is done through the URL path (`/api/v1/`)
- Breaking changes require a new API version
- Multiple versions can be maintained simultaneously
- Deprecated endpoints include sunset information in headers
